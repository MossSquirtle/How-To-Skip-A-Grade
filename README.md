# How-To-Skip-A-Grade
So, if you're like me , you want to skip a grade because you think you can, and I thought it was still possible however my mom asked the school and they had said no.
However , this is untrue and you CAN skip a grade but it is very difficult, as you have to take a test with high grades and meet the 8th grade 
requirements about how you can pass, and have to pass the tests. However, this is not the only way you can be done with a grade and you can
do high school grade work online while in another grade and this is probably what i'm going to do and will be rather difficult but will count
towards your credits and will help you know everything in the grade already even if it didn't, and would allow you to be far more intelligent
in the areas of your highschool classes than others, supposing they didn't do the same thing. 

You can contact me at sirsquirtlez@gmail.com , and I can tell you about the details for middle college as well.
